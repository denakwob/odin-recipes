      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Kontomire stew is a very popular staple dish in Ghana. It is traditionally made with cocoyam leaves <br> (called kontomire leaves) but can easily be made with frozen or fresh spinach. This stew can be made <br> vegan, but is traditionally seasoned with a variety of dried, canned, fresh, and even cured/fermented <br> fish. Ampesi is just the name of boiled plantain and yam. Since it is made with a ton of greens, this <br> dish is packed with nutrients and can be modified to suit different tastes. It is important to dispel the <br> idea that Black food canâ€™t be healthy or substitutions cannot be made without the dish still being able <br> to proudly claim its African roots.</p>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Place ginger, garlic, and habanero in a blender. Add up to 1/4 cup of water to help blend.<br> Set aside.</li>
        <li>Remove stems from cocoyam leaves and roughly chop.</li>
        <li>In your Perfect Pot, heat vegetable oil and add sliced onions. Saute onions for about 3 minutes <br> until they soften and start to brown slightly.</li>
        <li>Add parsley, smoked paprika, shrimp powder, and momoni (fermented fish) to the oil and saute <br> until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Momoni may break up in oil, so remove any bones if using. <br> Keep stirring to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Add blended ginger, garlic, and habanero mixture to the oil and saute briefly, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add diced tomatoes, breaking them up with the back of your Beechwood Spatula. Bring to a <br>light boil, then reduce to a simmer. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Simmer uncovered until the stew thickens and some water evaporates, about 10-15 minutes. <br> Remove cover, and stir egusi into stew. Cover again and simmer for 5-7 minutes without <br> stirring.</li>
        <li>Add spinach and cover. The spinach should wilt after about 3 minutes. When wilted, stir <br>spinach into tomato stew until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Add canned mackerel. Do not add tomato sauce from canned fish to your stew, as it changes <br> the flavor of the stew. I also remove the soft bone in the middle of the mackerel but this can be <br>left in, as it is soft and is not a choking hazard.</li>
        <li>Gently break up mackerel but keep the chunks fairly big. Simmer for 5-10 more minutes <br> uncovered.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with a side of boiled yam, boiled rice, or boiled plantain, an egg, and sliced avocado.</li>
      </ol>
